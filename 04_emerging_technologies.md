# Internet of Things (IoT)

## Purpose
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that enables them to collect, exchange, and act on data. Its main purpose is to enhance automation, improve efficiency, and provide real-time insights across different industries, including education and IT.

## Usage
- **In Education**:  
  IoT is common in attendance monitoring systems where students tap **RFID-enabled ID cards** when entering classrooms or school gates. The system logs attendance in real time and can send automatic updates to parents. Schools also use **smart TVs and projectors** that can be remotely controlled and updated with digital learning materials, making lessons more interactive and accessible. Some schools also use **smart air quality monitors** to make classrooms safer and more comfortable for learning.

- **In IT**:  
  In IT, offices and data centers use IoT for **server room monitoring** — sensors track temperature, humidity, and power usage to prevent system failures. IT departments also set up **smart security systems** with connected CCTV cameras and motion sensors, all accessible through a single dashboard.

## Examples

- **In Education**:  
  A university uses an IoT-based attendance system with **RFID-enabled ID cards**. Once students tap their ID at the classroom entrance, the system records the time and updates the teacher’s attendance dashboard instantly. This eliminates manual checking, reduces errors, and provides real-time data that can also be sent to parents or the registrar. Classrooms are equipped with **smart TVs and projectors** connected to the school’s network, allowing teachers to share lessons from a central repository, update content quickly, and make learning more interactive. 

  >IoT here improves efficiency, ensures accurate records, and enhances the teaching experience.

- **In IT**:  
  A company installs **smart CCTV cameras** with motion detection and remote access. IT administrators can monitor multiple locations in real time using a single dashboard, improving security and reducing the need for constant on-site checks. The office also uses **environmental monitoring sensors** to track temperature, humidity, and air quality in server rooms. This prevents overheating, equipment damage, and downtime by triggering alerts when conditions go beyond safe limits. 
  
  >IoT in IT ensures both operational safety and asset protection, supporting smooth and uninterrupted digital services.
