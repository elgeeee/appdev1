        <h2>Why I Want to Learn React</h2>
        <p>
          I want to learn React because it is a widely used technology in web
          development. It makes creating user interfaces more efficient and easier to manage. 
          By studying React, I can improve the way I design and gain practical skills that are valuable for both academic
          projects and future career opportunities.
